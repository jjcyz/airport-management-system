# An Airport Information Management System
*Created by Jessica Zhou*

**Task 1:**

This is an airport information management system. This program 
mimics the internal operations that happen at an international 
airport. It lets the user enter information about new passenger, 
planes, and create new flights. Possible features include different 
planes; adding passengers to the flight; listing all the passengers 
on the aircraft; and searching up flights to a given destination. 


**Task 2:**

###What will the application do?
<p>This application stores information that the user inputs about 
passengers, planes, and flights in a system such that it easy for 
the user to then pull information from the program to create new 
flights. Additionally, it can also search for existing flights 
given a destination.</p>


###Who will use it? 
<p>Airline managers who want to coordinate efficient operations at 
the airport through creating flights, booking passengers onto and 
off flights, and being able check for flights.</p>

###Why is this project of interest to you?
<p>The airport is such a vibrant and chaotic place. I am fascinate 
by how airport systems are able to coordinate the sheer amount of 
people, flights, and passengers coming from around the world. As a 
business and computer science student, I wanted to create a project 
that can manage the mass amount of information at a 
surface level.</p>

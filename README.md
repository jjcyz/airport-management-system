## An Airport Management System
*By Jessica Zhou*

**Task 1:**

An airport management system. It lets the user enter information about new passenger, planes, and flights. Possible features include different planes; adding passengers to the flight; listing all the passengers on the plane; and searching up flights given a destination.


**Task 2:**

* What will the application do?
<p>The application aims to store information about passengers,
planes, and flights in a system such that it mimics the operations 
at an airport such that it is easy for the user to pull information 
from the program efficiently.</p>


* Who will use it? 
<p>Airline managers who want to coordinate efficient operations at 
the airport through planing flights, and moving passengers onto and 
off flights, and being able check for flights that have a specific 
destination.</p>

* Why is this project of interest to you?
<p>The airport is such a vibrant and chaotic place. I am fascinate 
by how airport systems are able to coordinate the sheer amount of 
people, flights, and passengers coming from around the world. As a 
business and computer science student, I want to create a project 
that shows how a managing the mass amount of information at a 
surface level.</p>
